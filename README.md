# GUINow
Started working on this project to create an easy to use framework for 3DS homebrew application.
I've been working on this only for a few days, but i got pretty far if i may say so myself.
I'm aware of the poor coding style, but i'm not a C/C++ expert.

I eventually quit the project because i couldn't get it to compile as a library.
I actually got it to compile, but couldn't implement it in a project for some reason.

I've made some actuall homebrew applications with it.
With only a few lines of code it was pretty easy to create simple GUI's with event functionality such as onClick, onRelease, onHold, buttonpresses, timers.
There was also the possibility to create drawable objects, these could be used with the rest of the framework without customizeing it.
Easy usage of threads, different screens(windows), screenbuffers, controls such as buttons framerate, ...

This isn't the latest version of the framework.
I just made this public because i ran out of private space, and this is the least damageing project that i will allow to be public.
If someone is interested in the complete framework i will dig it up from a backup drive somewhere.
