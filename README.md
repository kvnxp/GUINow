####Introduction

I started working on this project in January 2016 to create an easy-to-use framework for 3DS homebrew applications.
This framework will be released with a the capabilities of:

> - A build in GUI
> - Window management
> - tools such as buttons, labels, slider, tabs, ...
> - object templates for easy creating a new object
> - events with the capability of creating your own
> - handeling fps, framebuffers
> - a network class to easily and stably use the internet
> - many more...

I'm aware of the poor coding style, but i'm not a C/C++ expert.
If you feel like it is too bad for a public github page, feel free to improve it.

I've had a setback where i couldn't compile the project successfully and gave up on developing this.
However since i wanted to improve my C++ i started working again in this end June 2016.
